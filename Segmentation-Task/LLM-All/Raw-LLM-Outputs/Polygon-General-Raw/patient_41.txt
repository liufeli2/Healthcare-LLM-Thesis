In this case, the output should be a tuple in the format of ((row1
Ground truth: [(72, 34), (72, 31), (73, 29), (74, 28), (79, 28), (83, 31), (84, 33), (83, 36), (82, 37), (73, 35)] || Model output: To find the answer, we need to analyze the FLAIR-mode brain scan image provided. The image appears to be a grayscale FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) mode MRI scan, which is often used for identifying lesions such as tumors in the brain.Step 1: **Identify the Tumor Region**: The brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures in the image corresponds to the region that should be traced for the polygon.Step 2: **Delineate the Tumor Boundary**: Carefully trace the boundary of the tumor region by identifying the pixels or voxel edges that demarcate this area from the rest of the brain. Ensure this boundary
