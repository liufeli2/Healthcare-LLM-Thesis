Since the number is between 10 and 15, we will use the formula.The output should be a tuple in the format of ((row1, col1), (row2, col2),..., (rowN,

The polygon coordinates can be determined by tracing the tumor boundary in a clockwise direction. To find the polygon coordinates, we need to analyze the image and identify the brightest region as the tumor. Once the tumor region is identified, we can trace the boundary in a clockwise direction, starting from any point on the boundary. We then measure the distance between each point and record their coordinates.Using the method outlined above, the polygon coordinates for the glioma in the query image are:((57, 89), (95, 93), (94, 107
