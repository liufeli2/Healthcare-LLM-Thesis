Ground truth: [(30, 105), (32, 105), (32, 107), (30, 107)] || Model output: **Step 1: Understanding the Problem.**\We are asked to provide a polygon with a specified number of points in a 128 Ã— 128 grayscale image. The polygon must trace the boundaries of a glioma, a type of brain tumor. The pixels within the glioma region will be the brightest and most distinct from normal brain structures. In addition, the query image is a brain scan and will be processed to generate an output.**Step 2: Generating Polygon Coordinates from Brain Scan Data**\The provided brain image and query image are provided for review.**Step 3: Conclusion**\To accurately calculate and create polygon coordinates, it is necessary to run image processing algorithms on

Ground truth: [(31, 105), (34, 105), (34, 107), (31, 107)] || Model output: **Step 1: Identify the brightest, high-intensity abnormality**In the grayscale FLAIR-mode brain scan image, there are multiple tumor regions with varying brightness and intensity. However, to determine the specific region of interest for which we need to generate coordinates of a polygon that encloses the tumor, we should identify the region with the most distinctive appearance from the rest of the brain structures.**Step 2: Determine the tumor boundary**Once the region of interest is identified, the next step involves drawing the polygon boundary around the tumor. Given that we have an 128x128 grayscale image, we will look for the coordinates within this range where the intensity of the image (the brightness level
