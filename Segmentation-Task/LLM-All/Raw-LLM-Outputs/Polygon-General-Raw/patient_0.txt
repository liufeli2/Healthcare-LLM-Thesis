The task is to identify the region of interest in the image and provide the coordinates of a polygon that accurately encloses the tumor region.**Step-by-Step Approach***   **Preprocessing**: Apply a binary thresholding operation to the image using a suitable value. This will convert the entire tumor area into white, allowing us to focus on the area without considering the rest of the image.*   **Find Contours**: Use a contour-finding algorithm to identify the boundary of the tumor area. Contours are boundaries that separate areas of different intensity (or pixel values) in the image.
