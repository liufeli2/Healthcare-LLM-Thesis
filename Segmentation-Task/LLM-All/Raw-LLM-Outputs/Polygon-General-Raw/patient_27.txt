This means we are looking for areas with high intensity (brightness) compared to the rest of the image.2. **Define the Coordinates System**: The image is in a 128x128 grayscale format. Each pixel has a value representing its brightness (from 0 to 255). The coordinates system starts from the top-left corner, increasing the row number downwards and the column number from left to right.3.

The scan is in grayscale FLAIR mode, and the tumor area appears as the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures.**Step 2: Analyzing the Image**The query image shows a brain scan with a distinct tumor area that can be identified by its high intensity compared to the surrounding brain tissue. The task is to create a polygon around this area using the coordinates of its outermost points in the 128 x 128 image.**Step
