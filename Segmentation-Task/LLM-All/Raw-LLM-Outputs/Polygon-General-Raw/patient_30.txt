This region can be visualized by taking the top 10-15 pixels with the brightest intensities. This code can take the image input and produce the bounding polygon points, where each point (x, y) corresponds to the location where it can be found in the output array. To determine if a point belongs to the brightest pixels in the image, each pixel in the array is multiplied with 3 times its original intensity. After that, a filter can be implemented to retain only the brightest top points that can define the area in which the gli
