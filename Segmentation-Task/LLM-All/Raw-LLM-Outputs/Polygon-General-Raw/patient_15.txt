The tumor region is the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures. We can start by identifying the region of the brain with the highest intensity.Upon examining the brain scan, we can see a region of high intensity in the center of the brain. We will use this region as our starting point for tracing the tumor boundary.To trace the boundary, we will use the grayscale value of each pixel to determine whether it is part of the tumor region or not. We will move outward from the center of the tumor in a clockwise direction, marking the boundary with our polygon.
