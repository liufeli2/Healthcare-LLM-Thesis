The ROI should be the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures. This can be done using techniques such as histogram-based thresholding.   - Optionally, apply morphological operations (e.g., erosion or dilation) to smooth out boundaries or remove noise.2. **Boundary Extraction**:   - After thresholding, apply the Hough transform (or another method for boundary extraction) to detect the edges
