FLAIR imaging helps in the visualization of edematous tissues surrounding areas of infarction by providing higher sensitivity than other MR techniques in the assessment of acute ischemia. FLAIR also provides better image quality with fewer artifacts in areas with large signal loss from susceptibility effects. Additionally, FLAIR is used to detect or exclude cerebral white matter lesions and to
