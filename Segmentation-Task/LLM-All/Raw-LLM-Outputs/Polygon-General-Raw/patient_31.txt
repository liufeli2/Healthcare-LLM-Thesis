In this case, we will use a threshold value of 128, which is approximately half of the maximum grayscale value.Next, we need to find the coordinates of the boundary points that enclose the tumor region. We can do this by scanning the image from top-left to bottom-right and identifying the points where the intensity changes abruptly. These points will be the vertices of our polygon.
