Ground truth: [(104, 76), (108, 76), (122, 78), (125, 82), (123, 84), (105, 93), (104, 93), (97, 87), (96, 81), (97, 79)] || Model output: To find the answer, we can analyze the brain scan provided.The query image shows a 128x128 grayscale FLAIR-mode brain scan. The tumor region is the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures. To output coordinates of a 10 to 15 point polygon that encloses the tumor region, we can use image processing techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, and region growing.Upon analyzing the image, we can identify the tumor region and trace its boundary using these techniques. The resulting polygon can then be represented as a tuple in the format of ((row1, col1), (row2, col2),..., (rowN, colN)), where
Ground truth: [(97, 81), (97, 80), (98, 79), (101, 77), (110, 77), (124, 81), (124, 82), (122, 84), (115, 86), (103, 87)] || Model output: (40, 85), (50, 85), (43, 71), (53, 58), (73, 44), (73, 32), (84, 18), (88, 29), (92, 39), (88, 50), (97, 66), (109, 76), (118, 87), (121, 96), (129, 98)
Ground truth: [(104, 87), (104, 83), (106, 82), (112, 81), (121, 81), (121, 82), (117, 85), (115, 86), (105, 87)] || Model output: The coordinates are as follows:(15, 62), (38, 63), (44, 54), (49, 44), (53, 32), (62, 25), (69, 23), (81, 25), (89, 28), (94, 34), (102, 43), (111, 51), (113, 58), (115, 61), (112, 65), (106, 67), (100, 69), (94, 70), (89, 69), (84, 64), (79, 60), (74, 58), (71
