This makes lesions or abnormalities stand out, particularly useful for visualizing demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis and acute infarction.2

Apply thresholding to the grayscale image to separate the tumor region from the rest of the image.3. Use blob detection to identify the tumor region as a single blob.4.
