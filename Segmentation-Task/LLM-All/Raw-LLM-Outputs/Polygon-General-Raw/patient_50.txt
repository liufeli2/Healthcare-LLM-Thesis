To determine the output coordinates of a 10 to 15-point polygon that encloses the tumor region, we need to carefully examine the image and define the boundary of the tumor.Upon visual inspection, we can identify the edge of the tumor as it transitions from high-intensity to lower intensity areas within the brain. To establish the coordinates of the polygon, we need to select distinct points along this edge. For simplicity and accuracy, let's start by choosing 10-15 points that define the outer boundary of the tumor. We aim to follow the contour
