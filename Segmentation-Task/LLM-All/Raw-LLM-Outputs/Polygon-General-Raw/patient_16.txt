If you have the query image and can describe the process in detail or provide more context, I can try to offer guidance on the general approach to solve such tasks using image processing techniques in Python or other relevant languages.

The tumor region in the FLAIR mode brain scan is the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures. To enclose this region with a 10-15 point polygon, we need to:1. **Thresholding**: Apply a threshold to the image to separate the tumor region from the background. This can be done by finding the minimum intensity value that still allows the tumor to be visible, or by using a histogram to determine the intensity range for the tumor region.2. **Morphological operations**: Apply dilation and erosion operations to close any holes within
