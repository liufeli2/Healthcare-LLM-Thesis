However, without direct visual cues or an annotated image, pinpointing exactly where this description applies isn't feasible from this text alone.2. **Polygone Determination:**   A polygon tracing the glioma's boundary requires identifying the shape and its corners or vertices. Given that the process involves complex medical imaging analysis to determine exact polygon points, and without access to visual or more descriptive data, a precise polygon calculation can

In FLAIR mode brain scans, the tumor region is typically the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures.2. Apply morphological operations such as closing, opening, or erosion to remove noise and artifacts from the image.3. Apply a connected component analysis to isolate the tumor region from other high-intensity regions in the image.4. Detect the bounding polygon of the tumor region by
