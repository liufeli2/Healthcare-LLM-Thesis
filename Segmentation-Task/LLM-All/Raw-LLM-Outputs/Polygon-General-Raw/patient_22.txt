The application of a 3x3 median filter may reduce the impact of this effect and other bright, non-tumor regions within the image. Using the filtered image, you can apply a Gaussian blob operator with 1.7 sigma to remove the bright ghosting artifacts, and the blobs will remain unaffected. The Gaussian blur will not significantly blur the bright edges of the tumor, since 1.7 sigma is larger than the maximum white ghosting artifacts in the ROI
