There's no need to convert it.2. **Thresholding**: Set a threshold based on the intensity levels to separate the tumor region from the rest of the image. This will create a binary image where the tumor appears bright, and everything else is dark. The threshold should be chosen carefully to minimize the inclusion of healthy brain structures.3. **Morphological Operations**: Perform opening and closing operations to eliminate small noise and smooth out the boundary of the tumor.
