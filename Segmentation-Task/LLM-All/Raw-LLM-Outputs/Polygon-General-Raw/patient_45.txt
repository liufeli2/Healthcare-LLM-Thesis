We can do this using image thresholding techniques, such as Otsu's thresholding or fixed thresholding.**Step 2: Contour Tracing**Once we have segmented the tumor region, we can use a contour tracing algorithm to find the polygon that encloses it. There are several algorithms available for this purpose, such as the Marching Squares algorithm or the Fast Marching method.**Step 3: Output Formatting**After we have found the polygon,
Ground truth: [(71, 63), (56, 66), (63, 58), (67, 56), (70, 56), (71, 57), (72, 60), (72, 62)] || Model output: To find the answer, we need to analyze the image and identify the tumor region. The query image shows a brain scan with a large white area indicating high intensity, which is distinct from the surrounding normal brain structures. This area appears to be the tumor region.To generate the polygon coordinates that enclose this region, we can use the following steps:1. Identify the row and column coordinates of each pixel in the tumor region.2. Sort these coordinates in clockwise order to define the boundary of the polygon.3. Round the decimal values of the row and column coordinates to integers between 0 and 127.4. Output the polygon coordinates as a tuple in the format ((row1, col
Ground truth: [(63, 60), (67, 55), (70, 56), (72, 57), (72, 63), (70, 65), (64, 62), (63, 61)] || Model output: **Polygon Coordinates for the Tumor Region:**((31, 68), (28, 31), (22, 34), (23, 51), (40, 68), (61, 83), (74, 68), (66, 56), (73, 36), (87, 42), (83, 38), (79, 57), (77, 64), (63, 58), (46, 63))
Ground truth: [(49, 64), (68, 56), (70, 56), (72, 57), (73, 62), (70, 65), (68, 65)] || Model output: To find the solution to this question, we need to use image processing techniques to identify and outline the tumor region in the given brain scan. Here are the steps:1. **Import libraries and load the image**: Import the necessary libraries such as numpy, scipy, and matplotlib to perform image processing tasks. Load the given 128x128 grayscale FLAIR-mode brain scan image.2. **Preprocess the image**: Convert the image to grayscale if it's not already done. Then, apply a median filter to reduce noise.3. **Thresholding**: Apply Otsu thresholding to segment the tumor region from the rest of the brain. This will give us a binary image with the tumor
