Ground truth: [(88, 33), (114, 20), (114, 23)] || Model output: To develop a robust solution for this task, we'll leverage image processing and computer vision techniques, specifically image segmentation. First, we'll enhance the image using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), a method to adjust brightness in each region of the image. This preprocessing step improves the visualization of the tumor region.After preprocessing, we apply thresholding to segment the tumor region from the background and other normal brain structures. The appropriate threshold is determined using histogram analysis or iterative selection based on image inspection. Thresholding separates the tumor region, and we proceed to apply region growing. This technique connects pixels based on similarity to find and bound the tumor, refining the outline to ensure only tumor pixels are
