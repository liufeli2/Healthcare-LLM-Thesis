However, since I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to analyze images or perform computations. But I can suggest that the task requires a combination of medical image processing techniques such as image thresholding, segmentation, and object detection. The steps might include:1. Load the brain scan image as a grayscale 2D matrix.2. Apply an appropriate threshold to segment the tumor region from the surrounding tissue.3. Perform connected-component labeling to isolate the tumor region from other high-intensity areas.4. Find the boundary of the tumor region by detecting edges or contours.5. Approximate the
