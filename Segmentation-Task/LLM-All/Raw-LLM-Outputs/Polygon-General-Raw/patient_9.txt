We know the tumor is in the right caudate and lentiform nuclei region, so we can use this information to estimate its location.After tracing the boundary of the tumor, we find that it appears to be in the superior frontoparietal region of the right hemisphere.

This would typically involve applying a threshold to the image to separate the high-intensity area from the rest of the brain, where the tumor appears brightest.2. **Boundary Detection**: After segmentation, the next step is to find the outer boundaries of the segmented tumor area. This could involve applying algorithms such as active contours without edges (snakes) or marker-controlled watershed transforms
