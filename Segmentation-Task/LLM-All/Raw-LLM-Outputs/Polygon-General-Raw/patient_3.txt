In this case, it is located in the left hemisphere of the brain.2.  **Detect the Boundary**: The boundary of the tumor region is not clearly defined and is likely to be blurred or fuzzy. We need to use an image processing technique, such as edge detection or contour tracing, to detect the boundary.3.  **Compute the Polygon**: Once the boundary is detected, we need to compute the polygon that encloses the tumor region. This can be done using a polygon

The steps are as follows:1. **Image Pre-processing:** The provided FLAIR-mode brain scan needs to be pre-processed to enhance the tumor region and reduce noise. This can be done by applying thresholding techniques, such as Otsu thresholding, to segment the tumor region from the rest of the brain.2. **Image Segmentation:** After pre-processing, we can use algorithms like K-Means clustering to further separate the tumor region from the rest of the brain. This will result in an image where the tumor region is represented as one cluster.3. **Contour Detection:** With
