To generate the polygon coordinates for the glioma, we can follow these steps:1.  **Locate the Glioma:** Identify the tumor region, the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures.2.  **Outline the Tumor:** Carefully trace the outer boundary of the glioma by drawing lines connecting the edges of the tumor with an idealized, straight line. This tracing process involves recognizing the points at which the glioma transitions from being surrounded by normal brain structures to the boundary where the brain appears healthy
