**Step 1: Understanding FLAIR-Mode Brain Scans**
â€¢ FLAIR-mode brain scans are a type of MRI that
Ground truth: [(64, 35), (64, 72), (124, 72), (124, 35)] || Model output: To extract the bounding box around the tumor region, we first need to locate and threshold the tumor based on its high intensity compared to the rest of the brain tissue. Assuming the provided FLAIR-mode brain

**Step 1: Image Processing and
Ground truth: [(69, 35), (69, 67), (126, 67), (126, 35)] || Model output: To solve this problem, we will utilize a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning. The steps involve pre-processing the image to enhance tumor visibility, followed by segmentation to isolate the tumor from the background
Ground truth: [(69, 36), (69, 67), (126, 67), (126, 36)] || Model output: **Step 1: Identify the tumor region.**

To segment the tumor region, we need to apply thresholding to the FLAIR-mode brain scan. Since the tumor is described as the brightest,

Ground truth: [(73, 36), (73, 67), (126, 67), (126, 36)] || Model output: The following code utilizes the OpenCV library in Python to segment the glioma from the FLAIR-mode brain MRI scan.

**Step 2: Preprocessing Steps**
* Read the input grayscale brain scan
