Ground truth: [(20, 75), (20, 126), (76, 126), (76, 75)] || Model output: **Tumor Bounding Box Coordinates**

The tumor region is the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures.

**Coordinates:**

Ground truth: [(25, 77), (25, 125), (76, 125), (76, 77)] || Model output: **Step 1: Preprocess the brain scan.**

*   Load the brain scan and convert it to a binary format where all pixel values above a threshold are set to 1 (bright pixels
Ground truth: [(26, 77), (26, 125), (77, 125), (77, 77)] || Model output: [(42, 54), (42, 90), (91, 90), (91, 54)]
Ground truth: [(26, 78), (26, 124), (77, 124), (77, 78)] || Model output: * The provided image is a grayscale brain scan with the tumor region being the brightest, high-intensity abnormality.
* The tumor appears to be located in the right hemisphere.

**Step 2:
Ground truth: [(25, 78), (25, 124), (77, 124), (77, 78)] || Model output: **Tumor Segmentation and Bounding Box Calculation**

**Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Image**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import filters
Ground truth: [(25, 78), (25, 124), (77, 124), (77, 78)] || Model output: **Step 1: Load Brain MRI Image and Perform FLAIR Modality Segmentation**

* Load the given 128x128 grayscale brain MRI image with FLAIR mode.
* Apply an appropriate algorithm
Ground truth: [(25, 79), (25, 123), (78, 123), (78, 79)] || Model output: **Step 1: Load the image**

The image has a size of 128x128 pixels. 

**Step 2: Find the region of interest**

The image has an abnormality region
