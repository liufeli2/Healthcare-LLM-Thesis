Ground truth: [(0, 69), (0, 81), (41, 81), (41, 69)] || Model output: Here is a succinct summary of the image description:

* The image shows a brain scan in FLAIR mode.
* The tumor is a bright, high-intensity abnormality that is distinct from the normal
Ground truth: [(0, 68), (0, 92), (39, 92), (39, 68)] || Model output: To create the bounding box around the tumor, the following steps are necessary:

* **Step 1: Tumor Identification**
 Identify the tumor region in the brain scan by locating the highest intensity region.
Ground truth: [(0, 67), (0, 91), (39, 91), (39, 67)] || Model output: [39, 34, 93, 88]
Ground truth: [(0, 67), (0, 92), (44, 92), (44, 67)] || Model output: The provided FLAIR-mode brain scan shows a high-intensity abnormality distinct from normal brain structures, which is consistent with a tumor region. The tumor appears to be located in the cerebral hemisphere, extending
