**Step 1: Preprocess the Image**

* Convert the grayscale
Ground truth: [(21, 13), (21, 51), (59, 51), (59, 13)] || Model output: To find the bounding box around the tumor in the brain scan, the following steps were performed:

1. **Preprocessing**:

   * Converted the FLAIR-mode brain scan into a 2D
Ground truth: [(22, 13), (22, 50), (55, 50), (55, 13)] || Model output: To accomplish this task, we will utilize the OpenCV library in Python, which offers excellent functionality for image processing and analysis.

First, we will load the grayscale brain scan using OpenCV.
