* The image displays a T2-weighted FLAIR sequence image (T2w-FLAIR), used to identify edematous or ischem
Ground truth: [(63, 27), (63, 46), (87, 46), (87, 27)] || Model output: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: We start by loading the given 128x128 grayscale brain scan image.
2. **Filtering**: Apply
