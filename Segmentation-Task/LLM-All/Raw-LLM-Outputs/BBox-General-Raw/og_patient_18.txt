* **Tumor Region Identification:** 45, 70
* **Tight Enclosure:** The bounding box tightly encloses the entire tumor without extending into non-tumor
Ground truth: [(81, 69), (81, 104), (127, 104), (127, 69)] || Model output: The bounding box that encloses the entire tumor can be determined by:

*   **Identifying the Tumor Region:**
    The tumor region is the brightest, high-intensity abnormality distinct from
Ground truth: [(79, 69), (79, 103), (127, 103), (127, 69)] || Model output: To generate the bounding box around the tumor, we will use the following approach:

1. **Import Libraries and Load Brain Scan**

    Load the provided 128x128 grayscale brain scan into Python,
Ground truth: [(81, 70), (81, 103), (127, 103), (127, 70)] || Model output: To derive the solution, we utilize the following key concepts:

**Image Preprocessing**

* Apply a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) algorithm to the original FLAIR-mode brain scan
